## Form.io Application Server
The Form.io Application Server is a performant run-time application server used to serve single project templates (including forms, resources, roles, etc) at a single deployed endpoint. It's goal is to enable rapid single tenant deployments where you wish to manage all Forms and Resources within a single location, but store the tenant data within their own database.

### Installation
To use this library, you must mount it within an Express.js application. As an example, you can create a simple Express.js application with this library by first creating a new [Express.js application](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) and then install and use the Server as follows.

```
npm install --save @formio/edge
```

Then within your server.js file, you would add the following.

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const { Server } = require('@formio/edge');
(async function bootup() {
    // Create the server.
    const server = new Server();

    // Initialize the server.
    await server.init();

    // Add the server router.
    app.use(await server.router());

    // Start server.
    app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
        console.log(`Server running on port ${process.env.PORT}`);
    });
})();
```

### Running Locally
To run this library locally, you can clone the repository, and then npm install.

```
yarn install
```

Then do the following.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, within the ```.env``` file, modify all of the environment variables to be the correct values. Next, you can run the server using the following.

```
node index
```

### Environment Variables
This library uses environment variables to configure the configurations required to run the server. These are as follows.

| Variable Name         | Required | Description | Example |
|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|
| MONGO | yes | Your MongoDB Connection string to use the default DB. | mongodb://localhost:27017/edge |
| PROJECT_ENDPOINT | yes | The endpoint for your deployed Form.io Enterprise project. | https://mydeployment.com/myproject |
| PROJECT_KEY | yes | The API Key for your deployed Form.io Enterprise Project. | abc123 |
| LICENSE_KEY | yes | Your License Key for this edge deployment. | <LONG LICENSE KEY> |
| PORT | no | The port that your server will run on. Default 3005 | 3005 |
| JWT_SECRET | yes | The key used to protect your JWT authentication tokens. | YOUR_SECRET_KEY |
| JWT_EXPIRE_TIME | no | The number of minutes to expire your JWT token. | 240 |
| PORTAL_SECRET | no | Provides the ability to connect to the edge via the Remote Environment Connection within your Developer Portal. | YOUR_SECRET_KEY |
| PROJECT_CACHE | no | Disables the cache for project resources (such as Project template, Project Settings, and Access Settings). Default "true" | true |
| MONGO_CONFIG | no | Additional configurations to add to the DB connection string | {} |

### Developer Portal Connection
Once you have the edge running within your own environment, and connected to your own database, you can now deploy your new changes to your forms, resources, project settings, etc. To accomplish this, you must first run the edge using the ```PORTAL_SECRET``` described above.

Once you have this set, you can then log into your Developer Portal, and then navigate to your Project.

Once there, you will then go to your **Staging | Connect Environment**.  Here you will put your edge endpoint and the PORTAL_SECRET value. You will then want to set the **Project Path Type** to use **Subdirectory**. Then click **Continue**. 

You will then see the next page, where you will select your Stage in the dropdown. You should see it since the edge connects to the project on bootup.

Once you are connected, any changes you make within the Developer portal will now be directly reflected within your edge deployment.

### Custom Configuration
The edge is very extensible, and many things can be altered and modified as well as custom implementations of different components are possible using configurations.

The following configurations can be provided to the Server instance. Here are some configurations that are supported.

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const { Server, Prepper } = require('@formio/edge');
const { CustomDB } = require('./customDb');
const { CustomAuth } = require('./customAuth');
const { CustomAction } = require('./actions/custom');
(async function bootup() {
    // Create the server.
    const server = new Server({
        /**
         * The "db" configuration provides a way to use a Custom database implementation.
         * 
         * See https://github.com/formio/edge/blob/main/src/db.ts for an example on 
         * how to implement your own custom db.
         */
        db: CustomDB,

        /**
         * The "auth" configuration provides a way to implement your own custom Authentication
         * system. 
         * 
         * See https://github.com/formio/edge/blob/main/src/auth.ts for an example on 
         * how to implement one.
         */
        auth: CustomAuth,

        /**
         * The "actions" is a map of new Actions you wish to implement into the application
         * server. Each one that is provided will then become available within the Form
         * builder and can be configured as an action that is executed when the form is 
         * submitted.
         */
        actions: {
            custom: CustomAction
        },

        /**
         * Preppers provide you a way to hook into the data preparation methods that are
         * called before the submission is saved into the database, as well as when the data
         * is read from the database and sent up to the client. They provide a way to manipulate
         * the data before it is transfered. A good example of a prepper is to remove any 
         * "protected" fields so they are not sent up to the client application. 
         * 
         * See https://github.com/formio/edge/tree/main/src/prepare for examples.
         *

         *

         *  - read: Called when the submission is being read from the database and sent to the
         *          client application.
         * 
         * The "scope" argument is a PrepScope type. See https://github.com/formio/edge/blob/main/src/types/submission.ts
         */

            save: Prepper.preppers.save.concat([

                    // Do something with "data" property to mutate data prepped.
                    console.log('Save Prepper 1');
